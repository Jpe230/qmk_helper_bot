QMK Helper
===

A Discord chat bot to facilitate linking to commonly used documentation for [QMK.](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/')

Bot Maintainer: [George Koenig (ridingqwerty)](https://github.com/ridingqwerty/)

Usage:

This bot is mostly for the benefit of the QMK Collaborators to be able to quickly link to documentation for something a QMK neophyte might need to be educated about.

Typing `!help` into any channel in the QMK Discord will cause the bot to PM a list of usable commands.

A Collaborator typing any of these commands will post a publicly viewable link into the channel it was called in.

Other users doing so will receive a PM of the documentation -- this is to prevent cluttering the help channels with embedded links.

The bot also responds to PMs directly, so users can interact with it privately if they would like.

Any suggestions are welcome!
